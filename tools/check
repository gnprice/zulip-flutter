# Careful! `set -e` doesn't do everything you'd think it does. In
# fact, we don't get its benefit in any of the `run_foo` functions.
#
# This is because it has an effect only when it can exit the whole shell.
# (Its full name is `set -o errexit`, and it means "exit" literally.)  See:
#   https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#The-Set-Builtin
#
# When one test suite fails, we want to go on to run the other suites, so
# we use `||` to prevent the whole script from exiting there, and that
# defeats `set -e`.
#
# For now our workaround is to put `|| return` in the `run_foo` just
# after each nontrivial command that isn't the final command in the
# function.
